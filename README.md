# SETUP

From your terminal, 
* run `git clone` to copy this repo to your local working directory.
* start the server `php -s 0.0.0.0:[port-number]`. For example, `php -S 0.0.0.0:2021`.

If you clone the repo into your already established application server which are being used 
to run PHP based apps, you don't need to start the server as instructed above.
